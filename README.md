# Simulation of the Hsp104/70/40 disaggregation system
This repo contains Python (version 3.7.7) Jupyter Notebook code for simulating the Hsp104/70/40 disaggregation system. The code was written as part of the published project ("Chaperones avidly disperse native stress-triggered condensates" by Yoo et al., 2021. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.13.444070v1).
